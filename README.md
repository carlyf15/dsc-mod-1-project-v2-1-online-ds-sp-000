### Questions posed & Conclusions 
---

### Future Recommendations to Microsoft 
---

<lo>
    <li> Further investigate streaming vs. theater budget</li>
    <li> Further investigate streaming profit vs in-theater profits</li>
    <li> Create a standardized way to categorize genres</li>
    <li> Fill in missing data for more accurate analysis</li>
    <li> Investigate viewership vs. box office gross</li>
</lo>

---
<lo>
	<li> Use an SQL database to compile the csv files from the start</li>

	<li> Make a more extensive plan of the analysis prior to executing</li>
